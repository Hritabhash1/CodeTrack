### Student Progress Management System
A MERN stack web application that allows institutions to manage students' Codeforces performance data, track their contest history and problem-solving progress, and automate reminders for inactivity.

### Features
## Student Table View
List of all students with the following information:

Name, Email, Phone Number, Codeforces Handle

Current Rating, Max Rating

Last Synced Time

Reminders Sent Count

Toggle to enable/disable email reminders

Add, Edit, Delete student entries

Search functionality by name

Export entire dataset as CSV

View individual student profile

### Student Profile View
When a student is clicked from the table:

Contest History

Filters: last 30, 90, or 365 days

Line graph showing rating changes over time

Table showing:

Contest Name, Rank, Rating Change

Problems unsolved by the student in that contest

Problem Solving Stats

Filters: last 7, 30, or 90 days

Most difficult problem solved

Total problems solved

Average rating of problems solved

Average problems solved per day

Bar chart of problems solved by rating bucket

Submission heatmap by date

### Codeforces Data Sync
Codeforces data is fetched daily at a configurable time (default: 2 AM) using a cron job

No live API calls during interaction hours

When a studentâ€™s handle is updated, their Codeforces data is synced immediately

### Inactivity Detection
If a student has no accepted submission in the past 7 days, an email reminder is sent

A count of reminder emails sent is stored per student

Email reminders can be turned on or off per student

### Other Functionalities
Dark and Light Mode with toggle

Mobile and tablet responsive UI

Well-organized and documented codebase
